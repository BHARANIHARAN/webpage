                <h2>Trojan Horses</h2>
                <p>Overview: Trojan horses disguise themselves as legitimate software or files to trick users into downloading them. Once activated, they can steal data, delete files, or provide remote access to attackers.</p>
                <p>
                    Examples:
                    Emotet: Initially a banking trojan, it evolved into a major delivery mechanism for other forms of malware, including ransomware.
                    Zeus: A trojan that primarily targets banking information, often used in large-scale fraud schemes.
                    Dangers: Data theft, financial fraud, system compromise, and acting as a gateway for other malicious software like ransomware.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Rootkits</h2>
                <p>Overview: Rootkits are tools used to gain unauthorized access to a computer and maintain privileged access over time. They can be difficult to detect because they are designed to hide their presence.
                   </p><p> Examples:
                    Stuxnet: A highly sophisticated rootkit that targeted industrial systems, specifically the Iranian nuclear program, causing physical damage to nuclear centrifuges.
                    Dangers: Undetectable access to systems, remote control by hackers, data exfiltration, and manipulation of system processes without detection.</p>
